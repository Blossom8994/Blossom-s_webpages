    <h3 id="The-Igbo-Culture">The Igbo Culture</h3>
    <p>The Igbo culture is one of Nigeria's major cultural groups, spanning over five states in southeastern Nigeria. It is rich in traditions, beliefs, and practices.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Language and Greetings</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Language:</i> The Igbo language has various dialects, but they are mutually intelligible. Common greetings include <q>Ndewo</q> (hello) and <q>Kedu</q> (how are you?).</li>
            <li><i>Respect:</i> Greetings are essential, and younger people are expected to greet elders respectfully.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Traditional Attire</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Clothing:</i> Men often wear <q>Isi Agu</q> (a lion-head patterned top) and red caps, signifying nobility. Women wear wrappers, blouses, and head ties, often accessorized with coral beads.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="The-Yoruba-Culture">The Yoruba Culture</h3>
    <p>
        The Yoruba culture spans over 10 states in southwestern Nigeria, making it more widespread than the Igbo culture. They are known for their traditional beliefs in <q><i>Olodumare</i></q> (their ancestor) and their stunning textile designs. The Yoruba cuisine includes dishes like <em>Amala</em>, <em>Efo</em>, and <em>Ewedu</em>.
    </p>
    <p>The Yoruba are also recognized for their tribal marks and the beauty of their women, which leaves many in awe.</p>

    <h3 id="The-Hausa-Culture">The Hausa Culture</h3>
    <p>
        The Hausa culture, rooted in northern Nigeria, is deeply influenced by Islam, shaping their traditions and daily life. Known for elegant attire, festivals like <q>Sallah</q> and <q>Durbar</q>, and rich cuisine such as <em>Tuwo</em> and <em>Suya</em>, the Hausa people blend heritage with modernity.
